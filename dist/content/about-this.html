<style> html { background-color: #649d73; } </style> <h1> about this </h1> <p> I created this page as a small project aiming to have something that is really performant, yet simple to use. It ended up to be a SPA framework created from the ground up without any external dependecies. </p> <p> One of the goals was to get the first paint as quickly as possible, and then load all other neccessary content in the background. This is done by inlining the neccessary CSS and HTML, and then requesting everyting else as resources. By combining this with a fast hosting option it is possible to get the first paint after 0.2s! The full Lighthouse report is available to <a>view here</a>. </p> <p> The source code is published on <a>my Github</a>. </p>
